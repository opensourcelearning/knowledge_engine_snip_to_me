==========

Provide apis that any third party website can use to allow people to send notes to any page of the website.

Any website can use this web service to configure how people can send notes to a page of the site. Normally the page is a topic of knowledge that people are trying to explore. People can cooperate on the exploration of knowledge by sending their Siginificant Experiences (in the form of notes) to that page, and the website can use a widget (we will also provide that widget) to attach the notes to the end of the page.
